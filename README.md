License

Unless otherwise specified, the resources found in this project belong to the «freeware world» — ie: resources which are known to have been made available for free sharing by their authors.

When it comes to Pixel-Art resources, it’s not always easy to trace back authorship and license terms: many resources haven been shared within Internet communities of aficionados of the genre (demoscene, pixel art forums, etc.) for a long time. The original websites or forums may no longer be active today, and some resources don’t carry embedded information about their author, creation date, and copyright status — which might have been lost along with the original pubblication posts.

> <h4>DISCLAIMER</h4>
> I assume in good faith that all the resources of this project are freeware and redistributable — I’ve done my best to ensure this, but I stand to be corrected!
>
> If you are the author of any resources found here, and you object to their presence in this project, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tajmone/pixel-art-supplies/issues/new) and I’ll take immediate action.
>
> Likewise, if you are aware of additional information about resources’ authorship and/or copyright status, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tajmone/pixel-art-supplies/issues/new) and share that information so that either their authors might be duely credited, and the resources license terms honored — or the resources be removed if the case demands it.
