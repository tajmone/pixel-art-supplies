# About The Project

**Pixel-Art Supplies** was created on July 10th, 2017 by Tristano Ajmone ([@tajmone](https://github.com/tajmone)).

## Goals

The goal of this repository is to gather freeware Pixel-Art related resources that might help pixel artists in their work. The areas of interest for this project include (but are not limited to) the following:

-   Bitmap fonts
-   Color palettes
-   Textures, tiles and backgrounds
-   Sprites and spritesheets for videogames development
-   Links and reviews of Pixel-Art tools and software
-   Links to Pixel-Art:
    -   Resources
    -   Communities
    -   Artists
-   Tutorials and technical docs

## License

Unless otherwise specified, the resources found in this project belong to the «freeware world» — ie: resources which are known to have been made available for free sharing by their authors.

When it comes to Pixel-Art resources, it’s not always easy to trace back authorship and license terms: many resources haven been shared within Internet communities of aficionados of the genre (demoscene, pixel art forums, etc.) for a long time. The original websites or forums may no longer be active today, and some resources don’t carry embedded information about their author, creation date, and copyright status — which might have been lost along with the original pubblication posts.

> <h4>DISCLAIMER</h4>
> I assume in good faith that all the resources of this project are freeware and redistributable — I’ve done my best to ensure this, but I stand to be corrected!
>
> If you are the author of any resources found here, and you object to their presence in this project, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tajmone/pixel-art-supplies/issues/new) and I’ll take immediate action.
>
> Likewise, if you are aware of additional information about resources’ authorship and/or copyright status, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tajmone/pixel-art-supplies/issues/new) and share that information so that either their authors might be duely credited, and the resources license terms honored — or the resources be removed if the case demands it.

## Contributing

Users’ contributions to the project are most welcome — we actually count on you to make this project grow. Resources can be added or edited via pull requests. Ideas, proposals and questions can be submitted by [opening an issue](https://github.com/tajmone/pixel-art-supplies/issues/new) on GitHub.

Feel free to create new sections in the project. Currently the project is too new to have taken any definitive organizational structure; as new contents will be added it will find its shape according to needs.


# External Resources

Some links to third party resources which might be of interest to the pixel artist.

## Color Tools

### PaletteMaker

- https://github.com/wqferr/palette-maker

A tool to create color palettes, designed with Pixel Art in mind. PaletteMaker uses HSV color space and offers some nice functionality to quickly create color ramps via an intuitive keyboard-oriented interface.

The app is fully standalone and cross-platform, created using [LÖVE] engine (Lua).
