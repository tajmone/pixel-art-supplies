# Resources List

-   [`/bmf-cz/`](./bmf-cz) â€” 1132 BMF fonts collection from [bmf.php5.cz](http://bmf.php5.cz/) (courtesy of CRS).

> **NOTE**: The `/bmf-cz/` folder was temporarily named so because of the connection to the [bmf.php5.cz](http://bmf.php5.cz/) website were the fonts can be found at. Folders names are just a means to maintain separation of contents (eg: actual fonts from fonts documentation or tools, etc.), and they will be subject to renaming as fonts get sorted into better categories (by authors, type, size, etc.).

# Disclaimer

I assume in good faith that all of these BMF fonts are freeware and redistributable. As the creator and maintainer of this repository, I ([@tajmone](https://github.com/tajmone)) take full responsibility for their distribution.

# Aknowledgments

I want to thank CRS from [bmf.php5.cz](http://bmf.php5.cz) for kindly sharing the BMF fonts found in the [`/bmf-cz/`](./bmf-cz) folder, and for his work of formats conversion.
